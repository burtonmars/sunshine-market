## Sunshine Market

### This is a work in progress...

Sunshine market is a full-stack NextJS app functioning as an ecommerce site for a fictional produce market. The app was designed by me from scratch using Figma and the code is my own except for the mongodb.js file and some of the api code, which are from a tutorial. The inspiration for this project was to build a NextJS app that incorporates mongoDB. I only have backend experience using SQL, so this will be a fun introduction to noSQL using a document store.

The project can be run locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
